## 3. 文生图提示词

### 镜头 S01_001

**提示词：** **English Prompt for AI Image Generation:**

"Far shot of a modern office setting. A young woman, Lin Xiaoyu, sits slouched at her cluttered work desk, surrounded by disorganized stacks of paperwork and scattered files, conveying a sense of chaos and fatigue.

Add subtle, relatable details like a coffee mug or sticky notes to enhance realism and relatability. Frame the composition for mobile viewing, with space for text overlays or potential meme captions on social media. Incorporate soft, glowing light from the screen for contrast, and add cinematic lighting with gentle gradients and flickering fluorescent lights. The overall mood should feel emotionally heavy but visually striking, suitable for internet culture and expression."

**Prompt for AI Image Generation:**

"A close-up shot of a young anime girl, Lin Xiaoyu, with shoulder-length sleek hair and modern styling. Her facial expression transitions fluidly from surprised to slightly impatient, her arched eyebrow conveying a sharp, sarcastic tone. She is mid-action, lightly tilting her head back while holding a smartphone in one hand, her thumb hovering near the screen as though preparing to block a message. The screen displays faintly visible text bubbles. Her expression is exaggerated yet nuanced, resembling a meme-worthy reaction. 

The art style is modern Japanese anime with high-quality rendering, featuring sharp lines and vibrant colors. Her skin glows softly, illuminated by cinematic lighting, with a slight rim light effect around her edges for added depth. The background is intentionally blurred with a gradient of soft pinks and purples, creating a contrast against her figure while maintaining focus on her emotions. Include subtle dynamic elements, like a slight motion blur or camera shake, to enhance visual drama and simulate the shake of the camera. 

The composition is optimized for mobile screens, with Lin Xiaoyu's face and upper torso occupying most of the frame. A few playful and minimalist overlays, such as faint digital icons or subtle sparkles, reference internet culture without overwhelming the image. Ensure the visual fits into the context of a social media post, emphasizing clear and expressive emotional appeal."
